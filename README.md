I am **ZXPrism**, a person who is insterested in a wide variety of things, especially in **computer graphics** and **embeded development**.

Sometimes I will craft some intriguing gizmos, like balance cars, railguns, etc. To be honest, none of them worked fine, but I just love them.

Lately I've been fascinated by Codeforces and my short-term goal is to be an **expert**. Not sure how long it will take - I will try my best.
