I am **ZXPrism**, an undergraduate from Zhejiang University majoring Electronic and Information Engineering.

I'm insterested in a wide variety of things, especially in **computer graphics** and **embeded development**.

Sometimes I will craft some intriguing gizmos, like balance cars, railguns, etc.

Lately I've been fascinated by Codeforces and my short-term goal is to be an ~~specialist~~ **expert**.
