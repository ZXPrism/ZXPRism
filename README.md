I am **ZXPrism**, a person who is insterested in a wide variety of things, especially in **computer graphics** and **embeded development**. **Theoretical physics**, **probability theory** and **game theory** are also much to my taste.

Sometimes I will try crafting some intriguing gizmos, like balance cars, railguns, etc. To be honest, none of them worked fine as expected, but I just love them.

In my spare time, I often solve CP problems from the platforms listed below. Not having paticipated in any offline contests before though, I wish I could have such opportunities in the future.
